      <h1>About Anaya Reversed 3D Puzzles</h1>
      <p class="about-intro">
        Hi, I’m Ayana 👋 I design and 3D-print small jigsaw puzzles meant for desks,
        gifts, and collectors. This project started as a fun way for me to combine
        my love of tech, sports, and puzzles into something people can actually hold.
      </p>

      <h2>The meaning behind the name</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>“Anaya Reversed”</strong> comes from my mom’s maiden name, 
        Anaya. Interestingly, when you spell it backward, it becomes my name—Ayana. 
        Over the years, people have often mixed the two up and called me Anaya anyway, so the connection has always been there. 
        Anaya Reversed 3D Puzzles felt like the perfect name: a personal nod to family, identity, and seeing things from a different perspective—just like a puzzle.

      <h2>A little about me</h2>

        <li>🏈🏀 I’m a big <strong>sports fan</strong> and you’ll see that in a lot of my puzzle themes and designs.</li>
        <li>🧩 3D-printed jigsaw puzzles started as a <strong>hobby</strong> and turned into a small passion project I share through “puzzle drops.” I am also using my technical skills to build my own website</li>

      <h2>What this site is for</h2>
      <p>
        Right now this site is a simple place to collect feedback from people who
        find my puzzle drops. Your comments help me decide which ideas to keep,
        which designs to improve, and what kinds of themes to try next.
